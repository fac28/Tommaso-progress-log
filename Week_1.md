## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of a learning outcome you have achieved this week.
 #### Server:
> **Understand when to install a Dependency as a Dev Dependency**  
> These are dependencies that are used during the development and testing phases of a project but are not required for the application to run in a production environment. They include tools, libraries, and utilities that help with tasks such as testing, code linting, code formatting, and development-related workflows.
> Navigate to the project directory, run (we' re using Eslint for this example)
> ``npm install eslint --save-dev``

 ### 2. Show an example of a learning outcome you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
